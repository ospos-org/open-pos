# Double-container Dockerfile for separated build process.
# If you're just copy-pasting this, don't forget a .dockerignore!

# We're starting with the same base image, but we're declaring
# that this block outputs an image called DEPS that we
# won't be deploying - it just installs our Yarn deps
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps

# If you need libc for any of your deps, uncomment this line:
# RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

# Copy over ONLY the package.json and yarn.lock
# so that this `yarn install` layer is only recomputed
# if these dependency files change. Nice speed hack!
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install

# END DEPS IMAGE

# Now we make a container to handle our Build

# Bring over the deps we installed and now also
# the rest of the source code to build the Next
# server for production

RUN yarn build

# Remove all the development dependencies since we don't
# need them to run the actual server.

# END OF BUILD_IMAGE
